# Expanded Background – The Faith Wars Universe

## 1. Cosmic Layer – The Meta Order
Above all pantheons lies the **Eternal Laws**, immutable rules that even the greatest gods cannot defy.

### The Eternal Laws
1. **The Law of Faith** – The strength of a god is directly proportional to the actual amount of faith they receive from humankind.
2. **The Law of Diminishing Belief** – As a religion fades from the minds of mortals, the power of its gods will wane until they vanish entirely from reality.
3. **The Law of Prophecy** – Not all prophecies are true, but each accurate prophecy leads to an unshakable “anchor point” in history that is nearly impossible to alter.

Rumors persist of an **Overbeing**, a force or entity above all pantheons, believed to be the one who set these laws in motion. None have met it—if it exists at all.

## 2. Geopolitical Layer – Pantheon Politics
Pantheons constantly engage in shifting alliances, betrayals, and covert operations to secure humanity’s faith.

### Inter-Pantheon Relations
- **Alliances and Betrayals** – Norse and Greek pantheons occasionally unite to weaken Egypt’s influence when ancient Egyptian worship surges due to archaeological discoveries.
- **Internal Conflicts**:
  - **Norse** – Odin vs. Loki; tension between preserving order and allowing Ragnarok.
  - **Greek** – Zeus vs. his children, especially Athena and Apollo.
  - **Egyptian** – Ra and Horus against Apep, with Seth as a wildcard.

Smaller pantheons—Japanese, Hindu, Mayan—sometimes instigate conflicts to **steal faith** when the three great pantheons weaken.

## 3. Mortal Layer – Faith War Map
Faith is not limited to ancient worship—it now flows from **modern culture**.

### Modern Faith Sources
When a god appears in popular media (films, novels, games) in a positive light, they gain a **Faith Surge**.

### Human Factions
- **Order of the Veil** – A secret society working to conceal the gods’ existence from humanity to prevent manipulation.
- **Cult of Ascension** – A faction devoted to helping one specific god dominate all faith on Earth.
- **Prophet Brokers** – Information dealers who sell prophecy data, often creating **false prophecies** to destabilize divine politics.
