# Mythbound: The War of Pantheons

## Premise
In a hidden layer of reality, countless pantheons from different mythologies coexist—Greek, Norse, Egyptian, and more. Each pantheon is ruled by a supreme deity: Zeus commands the Greek gods, Odin reigns over the Norse, Ra leads the Egyptian, and others hold dominion over their own realms.

## Divine Law
The gods draw their strength from the **Faith** of humankind. Every prayer, story, and belief directed toward a deity fuels their power. The more mortals believe in a god, the stronger that god becomes. 

However, the **Law of Boundaries** forbids any god from directly influencing the mortal world outside their own pantheon’s domain. Faith cannot be stolen openly; it must be earned—or taken—through indirect means.

To circumvent this, each god selects a mortal **Avatar**—a chosen individual who carries a fragment of their divine essence. These avatars serve as agents, messengers, and warriors, subtly shaping mortal belief on behalf of their patron deity.

## The Conflict
The balance between pantheons is fragile. Some gods respect the boundaries, focusing only on their faithful, while others exploit loopholes, using avatars to spread their name and influence far beyond their domains. Alliances form, betrayals simmer, and a cold war brews among the divine—each seeking to claim the hearts and minds of mortals.
