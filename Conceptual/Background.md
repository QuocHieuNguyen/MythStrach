# Mythbound: The War of Pantheons

## Premise
In a hidden layer of reality, countless pantheons from different mythologies coexist—Greek, Norse, Egyptian, and more. Each pantheon is ruled by a supreme deity: Zeus commands the Greek gods, Odin reigns over the Norse, Ra leads the Egyptian, and others hold dominion over their own realms.

## Divine Law
The gods draw their strength from the **Fate Threads** of humankind. These ethereal strands are tied to human destinies; the stronger and more numerous a god's connections, the greater their power. However, the **Law of Boundaries** forbids any god from directly influencing the mortal world outside their own pantheon’s domain.

To circumvent this, each god selects a mortal **Avatar**—a chosen individual who carries a fragment of their divine essence. These avatars serve as agents, messengers, and warriors, shaping human fate on behalf of their patron deity.

## The Conflict
The balance between pantheons is fragile. Some gods respect the boundaries, while others exploit loopholes, manipulating avatars to claim Fate Threads from beyond their domains. Alliances form, betrayals simmer, and a cold war brews among the divine.
