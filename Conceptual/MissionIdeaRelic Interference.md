## Mission Idea: Relic Interference

When Odin senses *something is off*, he tasks his Avatar with investigating rumors of a recently unearthed relic that hums with unnatural energy. The artifact isn’t just ancient—it’s tethered to a forgotten pact between pantheons, a key that could shift the balance of the Faith Wars.

The protagonist’s background as a **rogue archaeologist** gives him an edge: he knows the black market circuits, the smugglers who move artifacts under the radar, and the tomb raiders who will kill to keep a discovery secret. However, this time, the interference isn’t just mortal greed—another divine power is trying to awaken the relic for its own ends.

**Complications:**
- The relic is hidden in a war-torn zone, requiring infiltration through mercenary-controlled territory.
- A rival artifact hunter—once an ally, now a competitor—has already secured a lead.
- The protagonist must decide whether to destroy the relic, deliver it to Odin, or keep it hidden from all gods.

**Tension Point:** The relic’s activation could erase the *Pantheon of Veilborn*—a tiny, almost-forgotten divine family tied to secrets and shadow. The Veilborn’s Avatar, a cunning operative with deep personal ties to the pantheon, is racing against the protagonist. While Odin sees the Veilborn as an irrelevant obstacle, their Avatar will stop at nothing to save their gods, making them a direct and dangerous rival.
