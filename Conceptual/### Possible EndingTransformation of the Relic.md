### Possible Ending — Transformation of the Relic

At the final moment, the protagonist doesn’t destroy the relic outright. Instead, using both mortal cunning and Odin’s shard of wisdom, he alters its essence—shifting its attunement so that only the gods of the Pantheon of Veilborn can wield its power.  

In doing so, he ensures the Veilborn will not fade from existence, while denying the relic’s immense potential to every other pantheon. The artifact remains whole in form but forever locked away from foreign hands.  

Odin’s reaction is far from mild—his voice thunders across the Avatar bond, brimming with restrained fury. To him, this is a reckless squandering of a powerful bargaining chip that could have altered the balance of the Faith Wars. Yet, it is not outright betrayal; it is the defiance of a chosen champion who acted on his own sense of justice, prioritizing mortal consequences over divine strategy.  

The Veilborn survive, strengthened but still fragile. Their Avatar offers a wary nod of gratitude, recognizing that this act has preserved their future, even if it has also made them a new target in the endless shadow war.
