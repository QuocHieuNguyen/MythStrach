## The Fragmentation of Faith

In the world of *Faith Wars*, a god’s power depends not only on the number of believers, but also on how unified their image and story are.  
Gods of ancient pantheons often possess a clear and consistent form, allowing them to channel their power into a single, focused Avatar.

In contrast, the supreme beings of major world religions often exist in many different interpretations, varying by region and sect:  
- In some places, they are seen as pure light.  
- In others, as a stern and absolute judge.  
- Some believe they once walked the earth as a mortal.  
- Others view them as an abstract, formless concept.

This diversity leads to **fragmentation of faith**, scattering their divine power into countless, weaker shards.  
If an Avatar were to appear, there would immediately be factions declaring, *“That is not our Lord,”* causing their collective power to withdraw.

As a result, such gods rarely take part in direct battles. Instead, they influence events indirectly through symbols, teachings, or individuals who claim to act under their inspiration.
