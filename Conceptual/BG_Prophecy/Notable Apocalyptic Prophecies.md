# Notable Apocalyptic Prophecies

## 1. Ragnarok (Norse Pantheon)

**Summary**  
Ragnarok is the prophesied end of the Norse gods, marking the destruction and rebirth of the world. The event includes:
- The death of Odin at the hands of Fenrir
- Thor’s fatal battle with Jörmungandr
- Surtr engulfing the world in flames
- The world sinking beneath the ocean, only to rise anew

**Key Signs Leading to Ragnarok**
1. **Fimbulwinter** – a three-year-long winter with no summers in between
2. The breaking of **Fenrir’s chains**
3. The arrival of **Loki’s army** from Hel
4. **Naglfar**, the ship of the dead, setting sail

**Impact on Odin’s Strategy**
- Relentless search for ways to either bind or control prophecy’s agents (Fenrir, Loki)
- Investing power into Avatars capable of reshaping human faith to fortify divine strength
- Attempting alliances—even with rival pantheons—if it means delaying the inevitable

## 2. The Child Who Will Overthrow Zeus (Greek Pantheon)

**Summary**  
The Oracle of Delphi once whispered a prophecy:  
> “A child of Zeus will rise to cast down the father, as the father once cast down his own.”  

This mirrors the cycle in Greek myth:
- **Cronus** overthrew **Uranus**
- **Zeus** overthrew **Cronus**
- Now, Zeus fears the same fate

**Implications for Zeus**
- Relentless paranoia toward his own children, both mortal and divine
- History of swallowing potential threats (as Cronus did), either through exile, imprisonment, or manipulation
- Strategic romantic entanglements to produce loyal offspring while keeping potential rivals in check

**Countermeasures**
1. **Splintering Faith** – ensuring no single demigod or deity amasses enough mortal worship to rival him
2. **Manipulating Prophecy** – commissioning oracles to alter the story in the mortal realm
3. **Pantheon Politics** – using allies to spy on or sabotage potential “children of destiny”
