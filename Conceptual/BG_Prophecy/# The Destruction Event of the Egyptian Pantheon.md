# The Destruction Event of the Egyptian Pantheon

> *"Like sandstorms veiling the sun, the prophecies of the soul-masters are always blurred by the winds of time…"*

## Overview
The Egyptian Pantheon has long existed in a fragile balance.  
No single prophecy is universally accepted — only scattered fragments, rumors, and recurring dreams whispered by seers.

These prophecies often contradict each other, sometimes looping in cycles, leading to doubt… yet planting seeds of fear among the gods.

## Most Widely Known Scenarios

### 1. **The Darkness of Apep**
- **Prophecy**: One night, as Ra’s Solar Barge sails through the Duat, Apep will not be repelled but will swallow the sun forever.  
- **Consequences**:  
  - The sun will never rise again.  
  - The Nile will dry up.  
  - All souls will wander lost in chaotic darkness.  
- **Status**:  
  - Ancient records claim “that day” has already come… but all turned out to be **false prophecies** — solar eclipses, sandstorms, or mere superstition.  
  - Ra remains ever-vigilant, and each night the battle with Apep grows more desperate.

### 2. **The Overthrow by Seth**
- **Prophecy**: Seth — the warrior who guards the Solar Barge — will one day betray Ra, using Apep’s assault as the perfect moment to seize the throne.  
- **Consequences**:  
  - The Pantheon fractures into the Desert Faction and the Nile Faction.  
  - Temples crumble; the power of faith bleeds away.  
- **Status**:  
  - Some gods believe this is Horus’s propaganda to discredit Seth.  
  - Temple carvings in Abydos depict Seth on the throne, with Ra chained at the bow of the barge.

## Other Obscure Prophecies
- **The Nile Flows Backward** — a sign of cosmic upheaval.  
- **Ra’s Eye Shatters** — the sun’s power begins to wane.  
- **The Starless Night** — when the sky is drowned in darkness without a single light.

## Commentary
This Destruction Event — in any of its versions — is always tied to the Pantheon’s greatest fear: **loss of order, loss of light, loss of faith**.  
And in a world where **faith is a resource**, the collapse of belief means an irreversible end.
