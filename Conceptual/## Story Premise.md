## Story Premise

The story begins with the protagonist already serving as Odin’s Avatar for some time — long enough to have grown accustomed to the divine bond, yet still wrestling with the weight of Odin’s will. Life in the shadow of the gods is dangerous but predictable… until something changes.

Across all pantheons, a strange unease begins to ripple through the divine realms. Gods from every corner — Norse, Greek, Egyptian, and beyond — feel it deep within their essence: something is off. The air of inevitability hangs heavy, as if fate itself has shifted course.

No one knows the true cause.  
- Some whisper it is connected to the prophesied apocalypses of various pantheons — Ragnarök, the fall of Olympus, the victory of Apophis over Ra.  
- Others suspect it is a brewing coup: a lesser pantheon preparing to topple the existing order and break into the coveted Top Three.

Whatever the truth, every pantheon begins making quiet preparations — forging alliances, gathering mortal Avatars, and subtly moving their pieces on the Faith War board.  
The protagonist finds himself caught in the center of these currents, his loyalties and humanity tested as the hidden storm approaches.
