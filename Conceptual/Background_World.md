# Faith War Map

## Overview
Faith is the lifeblood of the gods. The more mortals believe in a deity, the greater that god's influence and power. Across the hidden spiritual geography of Earth, the pantheons wage an invisible war for control over mortal belief. 

This war is fought on two fronts:
1. **Inter-Pantheon Rivalry** – The struggle between different pantheons for dominance.
2. **Intra-Pantheon Politics** – Power plays, rivalries, and betrayals within each pantheon.

## Major Powers

### The Great Three

3. **Egyptian Pantheon** – Led by Ra. Ancient, deeply rooted in history and mystery. Strongholds include North Africa, the Middle East, and esoteric cult networks.

## Rising Powers
- **Japanese Pantheon (Shinto)** – Led by Amaterasu. Focused on cultural preservation and subtle, soft-power expansion.
- **Hindu Pantheon** – Led by Vishnu. Holds a vast natural faith base but seeks to project influence beyond its traditional regions.
- **Others** – Celtic, Mesopotamian, Mesoamerican pantheons lurking on the fringes, waiting for opportunities to reclaim lost faith.

## Faith Battlefronts

### Stable Zones
Regions dominated by a single pantheon for centuries, nearly impossible to infiltrate without extreme measures.

### Contested Zones
Areas where two or more pantheons compete heavily, often through avatars and mortal institutions. Belief systems are in flux, making these prime battlegrounds.

### Emerging Zones
Territories where old beliefs have weakened, creating openings for new pantheon influence. These zones are targeted for ideological “colonization.”

## Methods of Influence
- **Avatars** – Chosen mortals who act as champions, diplomats, and infiltrators.
- **Cultural Seeding** – Inserting mythological elements into art, entertainment, and education.
- **Sacred Site Control** – Capturing or corrupting key locations of worship to redirect faith flow.
- **Symbol Wars** – Spreading divine symbols in public consciousness to reinforce belief.

## Protagonist's Position
The Avatar of Odin enters the war at a dangerous intersection—tasked with protecting Norse interests abroad while navigating the treacherous politics within the Norse pantheon itself. His appointment stems from Odin's unfulfilled promise to the previous Avatar, making him both an outsider and a symbol of old debts.
